# My FARA (FAUX YARA) solutions
My FARA (Faux YARA) solutions. Thanks [@bartblaze](https://github.com/bartblaze) for the great content. His original repo is [here](https://github.com/bartblaze/FARA/tree/main).

>FARA, or Faux YARA, is a simple repository that contains a set of purposefully erroneous Yara rules. It is meant as a training vehicle for new security analysts, those that are new to Yara and even Yara veterans >that want to keep their rule writing (and debugging) sharp.

This repo contains my solutions for all the FARA rules proposed. If you find some errors, let me know!
