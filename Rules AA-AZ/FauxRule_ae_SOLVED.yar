}

/*a few notes
1st loop:
does $a exist? yes

and so on

for all i in (1..#a) : ( @a[i] < 100 )

In this case weâ€™re iterating over every occurrence of $a (remember that #a represents the number of occurrences of $a). This rule is specifying that every occurrence of $a should be within the first 100 bytes of the file
